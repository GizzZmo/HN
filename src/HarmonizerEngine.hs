-- Define core data types for an Echo and its Emotional Signature
-- An Echo is a raw narrative fragment, anonymized.
-- An EmotionalSignature is a structured representation of its core feeling.
data Echo = Echo {
    echoId :: String,
    rawContent :: String,
    contextTags :: [String] -- e.g., "loss", "triumph", "injustice", "belonging"
} deriving (Show, Eq, Ord) -- Added Ord for comparison based on echoId

-- A simplified Emotional Signature for demonstration. In reality, this would be
-- a complex, multi-dimensional vector derived from advanced NLP.
data EmotionalSignature = EmotionalSignature {
    coreFeeling :: String, -- e.g., "Joy", "Sorrow", "Hope", "Fear"
    intensity :: Float      -- 0.0 to 1.0
} deriving (Show, Eq)

-- A potential Resonance Path candidate, connecting two Echoes.
data ResonancePathCandidate = ResonancePathCandidate {
    echoA :: Echo,
    echoB :: Echo,
    sharedSignature :: EmotionalSignature,
    connectionScore :: Float -- How strong is the empathetic link?
} deriving (Show, Eq)

-- Pseudo-code:
-- Function: extractSignature
--   Input: An Echo
--   Output: Its EmotionalSignature
--   Process: (Conceptual NLP/ML process) Analyze rawContent and contextTags to derive coreFeeling and intensity.

    -- For demonstration, let's pretend it magically knows.

             | otherwise -> EmotionalSignature "Neutral" 0.5

-- Pseudo-code:
-- Function: calculateResonance
--   Input: Two EmotionalSignatures
--   Output: A tuple (SharedSignature, ConnectionScore)
--   Process: Compare signatures. If coreFeelings are similar and intensities align,
--            calculate a score. Prioritize connections across diverse contextTags.

-- Helper function to determine if two echoes have diverse contexts.
-- "Diverse" means they have tags unique to each, indicating different primary contexts,
-- while also having some shared tags (like the shared emotional feeling itself).
-- This allows for bridging between different backgrounds while focusing on shared humanity.

-- Pseudo-code:
-- Function: generateCandidates
--   Input: List of all Echoes
--   Output: List of ResonancePathCandidates
--   Process:
--     1. For every unique pair of Echoes:
--     2.   Extract signatures for both.
--     3.   Calculate resonance between signatures.
--     4.   If resonance is high AND contextTags are diverse (e.g., different continents, cultures, socio-economic backgrounds):
--     5.     Create a ResonancePathCandidate.
--     6. Return all candidates.
