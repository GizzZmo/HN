# Harmonia Nexus: The Echo Chamber of Shared Humanity
## Usage Example

To query empathy module:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"message":"I feel anxious about the future."}' \
    http://localhost:5000/empathy-query



//**
## Harmonia Nexus is a conceptual application designed to foster world peace not by enforcing it, but by cultivating deep empathy, shared understanding, and the recognition of common humanity beneath layers of difference. It operates on the profound principle: **Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the presence of understanding.**

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a multi-paradigm approach to building a complex system. Each core component leverages a programming paradigm best suited for its specific conceptual role:

1.  **The Harmonizer Engine (Functional Paradigm - Haskell)**
    *   **Location:** `src/HarmonizerEngine.hs`
    *   **Role:** The pure, immutable core that takes raw, anonymized "Echoes", analyzes their emotional signatures, and generates potential "Resonance Path" pairings without bias or state. Ideal for reliable, predictable data transformation.

2.  **User & Echo Management (Object-Oriented Paradigm - Python)**
    *   **Location:** `src/user_management/user_model.py`
    *   **Role:** Manages individual users, their submitted "Echoes", and their interactions with "Resonance Paths". Models real-world entities with encapsulated data and behaviors.

3.  **Universal Empathy Database (Declarative Paradigm - SQL Schema)**
    *   **Location:** `src/database/schema.sql`
    *   **Role:** Defines the structure of the vast, anonymized repository of all "Echoes", their categorizations, and the established "Resonance Paths". Describes *what* data exists and *how* it relates, ensuring data integrity.

4.  **Perspective Bridging Algorithm (Logic Programming - Prolog)**
    *   **Location:** `src/logic/bridging_rules.pl`
    *   **Role:** Uses logical rules to infer and suggest "Resonance Paths" that are particularly effective at bridging perceived societal or cultural divides, identifying connections that challenge biases or foster understanding where it's most needed.

## Web Interface (Conceptual Frontend)

To provide a user experience, a basic web frontend is conceptually included, demonstrating how users would interact with the system.

*   **HTML:** `web/index.html` - The main structure of the web application.
*   **CSS:** `web/css/style.css` - Styling for the web interface.
*   **TypeScript:** `web/ts/app.ts` - Client-side logic for user interactions, submitting echoes, and exploring paths. (A `tsconfig.json` is provided for TypeScript compilation).

## Getting Started (Conceptual)

This project is a conceptual blueprint. To bring Harmonia Nexus to life, you would typically need:

*   **Haskell Environment:** To compile and run the Harmonizer Engine.
*   **Python Environment:** To run the User & Echo Management layer, possibly as a backend service interfacing with the Haskell engine.
*   **Prolog Interpreter:** To run the Perspective Bridging Algorithm.
*   **SQL Database:** A relational database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to host the Universal Empathy Database defined by `schema.sql`.
*   **Web Server:** To serve the `web/` directory and potentially a backend API (e.g., built with Python, Node.js, or Haskell's web frameworks) that orchestrates communication between the frontend and the core logic components.

**To run the frontend (development only):**

1.  Ensure Node.js and npm/yarn are installed.
2.  Navigate to the `harmonia_nexus/` directory.
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
4.  Compile TypeScript: `npm run build:ts` (or `npm run watch:ts` for continuous compilation)
5.  Open `web/index.html` in your web browser.

**Note:** The core logic components (Haskell, Python, Prolog) are standalone conceptual implementations. Integrating them into a single, cohesive application would require establishing communication protocols (e.g., REST APIs, message queues) between them.

## Vision of Peace Through Harmonia Nexus

Harmonia Nexus understands that world peace isn't a destination but a continuous journey of understanding. It doesn't impose solutions but illuminates the shared human landscape, inviting each individual to walk a mile in another's heart. By revealing that the deepest joys, sorrows, fears, and hopes are universal, regardless of superficial differences, Harmonia Nexus quietly, powerfully, cultivates the empathy necessary for a world where peace isn't just a dream, but a lived reality.
